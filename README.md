# instapost readme

Work in progress to re-create Etsy with React and Rails with PostGres.   

Immediate next steps: 
- [ ] Work through post.user associations problem. See stackoverflow question [here.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66019588/rails-post-controller-not-passing-user-association-to-react-view) Note known bug.
- [ ] Entirely revamp styling to match Etsy. Currently, just stock pasted together from other projects.
- [ ] Create post upload form
- [ ] Activate ActiveStorage so users may upload photos of images
- [ ] Add additional associations not yet present
- [ ] Write tests
- [ ] Heroku, Netlify, or some other host
